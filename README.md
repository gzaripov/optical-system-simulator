# Optical System Simulator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/gzaripov/optical-system-simulator.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/facebook/create-react-app)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The idea of this project was to build a light transport simulation using the same mathematical tools used in academic and movie production renderers, but in a simplified 2D setting. The 2D setting allows for faster render times and a more accessible way of understanding and interacting with light, even for people with no prior knowledge or interest in rendering.
